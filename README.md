## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation is the idea of building a full-featured web app and ensuring that if parts of it fail,  due to poor network conditions or limited browser support, the app still works in a reduced but usable way. Service workers support graceful degradation by allowing the app to cache important resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data. Even if the user is offline or on a slow connection, the service worker can serve cached recipes and assets, allowing the app to continue functioning without breaking entirely.
